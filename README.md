# Movie CLI App

This app allows you to input the name of any movie as well as an optional year of release and receive information about that movie from the OMDB API. If you do not provide a year, the app will simply return the first movie with that includes the name you specified. For example, if you were to type "batman" and not provide a year, you would receive information on the movie "Batman" from 1989, however if you were to enter "batman" and then "2012", you would receive information on "Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1" from 2012. After pulling the information from the API, you may request the genre, IMDB rating, summary of the movie, year it was released or the length of the movie.
